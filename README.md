# Dual Robotic Arm Collaboration System

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a dual robotic arm collaboration system, consisting of a primary robotic arm and an auxiliary robotic arm. Through coordinated operation, the system will autonomously perform complex tasks such as assembling car models.

The system will possess the ability to autonomously design and manufacture components. Using technologies like 3D printing, it will generate new parts and automatically install or replace them to adapt to various task scenarios.

## Project Goals

1. **Basic Dual-Arm Collaboration Tasks**  
   The minimum requirement of the system is to complete the assembly of car models through dual-arm collaboration, laying the groundwork for more complex future tasks.

2. **Autonomous Design and Manufacturing**  
   The system will autonomously generate specific tools or components required for tasks, leveraging 3D printing and similar technologies to manufacture and install them.

3. **Dynamic Adaptability**  
   By analyzing task requirements in real-time, the system will dynamically adjust arm configurations and operational modes.

## Features

- **Autonomous Part Design and Manufacturing**  
  - The system analyzes task requirements to generate component designs.  
  - It uses 3D printing to automatically produce the necessary parts.

- **Automated Installation and Replacement**  
  - The system can identify part types and autonomously replace or install tools on the robotic arms.

- **Intelligent Dual-Arm Collaboration**
